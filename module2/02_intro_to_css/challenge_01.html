        <p>The <em>retriever dog</em> is awesome because <strong>The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. They are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers. ... They are not often barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good watchdogs.</strong>.</p>
