    <h3 id="Jollof_Rice">Jollof Rice</h3>

    <p>Jollof rice is one of the most common West African dishes eaten in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia. However, each of these West African countries has their own variation of this meal.  It is inexpensive and easy to make yet, delicious.
    <h3>HOW TO COOK JOLLOF RICE</h3>
<p>When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump your ingredients in the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call ”concoction”. Each step counts so try to do each of the steps in detail.</p>
<ol>
	<li>The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.
</li>
	<li>Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time this ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning them.
</li>
	<li>Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the sauce becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know but just in case, you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.
</li>
	<li>Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but optional) and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point, then, I stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. Now add the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.
</li>
	<li>Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
	<li>
Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantains.
</li>

    <h3 id="PepperSoup">Africa Goat Pepper Soup</h3>
		<p>    African pepper soup is a hearty African soup made with Goat meat cutlets or chunks, pepper soup spice and other beautiful condiments.  If you are looking for an authentic African Goat meat pepper soup, this soup certainly delivers the big, bold African flavors you will love.<br>
		Almost every culture on earth has its soup recipe and Africa is not an exception. In fact, soups and stews are a significant component of the African cuisine, and we have a whole lot of it apart from this pepper soup recipe like Turkey Stew, Ayamase stew, Stewed Spinach (Efo riro), Egusi Soup, Banga Soup, chicken pepper soup and much more.
		</p>
		<h3>HOW TO PREPARE THE AFRICAN GOAT PEPPERSOUP</h3>
		<ol>
			<p>This pepper soup is suitable for all seasons of the year, and it will also add a little more zing to your day if you are not feeling so well but not to worry if you don’t want it hot, feel free to reduce the quantity of Habanero peppers and the chili pepper.</p>
			<li>You can substitute dry ginger powder for fresh ginger if you choose.</li>
			<li>The amount of peppers you add to the pepper soup depends on your heat tolerance so feel free to increase or reduce the quantity of peppers you use.</li>
			<li>You can substitute Uziza leaves or bitter leaves with Parsley, mint leaves or scent leaves; Be sure to wash bitter leaves and drain them when used.</li>
			<li>I have used Goat Meat in this recipe. However, you can also Chicken, Lamb, Beef, or Fish.</li>
			<li>I like to cut the goat meat into cutlets because it cooks faster. You can also easily pick it up with a spoon and eat right away. If You are comfortable with chunky meat in your pepper soup please go with it but it might need to cook for a longer time.</li>
			<li>To avoid chunks of Onions in your pepper soup, it’s a good idea to either mince the Onion or use the smaller hole on the grater to grate the Onion. I like to use the later in my pepper soup.</li>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE SALMON SALAD</h3>
<p>Salmon salad is a mixture of flavors and textures; we have the crunchiness cucumber and lettuce, sweetness from the tomatoes, saltiness from the olives and tangy with a hit of sweetness from the dressing. <br>
This is one of the easiest, healthy dinner meal that makes you feel good with every single bite. It’s rich in nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and fiber. Plus it’s on the table in less than 20 minutes!</p>

<ol>
	<li>FIRST STOP – CRUNCHY SALAD<br>
This takes about 10 minutes from start to finish. All you need is chop the lettuce, chop the bell pepper, half the Cherry Tomatoes, slice the cucumber and the onions.
</li>
	<li>NEXT UP IS THE PAN-SEARED SALMON<br>
To pan-sear the salmon, heat some olive oil in a large nonstick pan over high heat. Add the seasoned salmon fillets cook for 5 to 6 minutes turning halfway between. This gives you a seared salmon that is nicely charred and crisp on the outside.
